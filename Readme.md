## Manual Test procedure for the Che installation on OpenShift 4.3 clusters in restricted environments

### Introduction

This procedure provides steps to easily test the compatibility of Che/CRW Operator
with the OpenShift 4.3 documentation about installation in restricted environments.

Source documentation used to build this procedure can be found at the following links:

- [About preparing the mirror docker registry](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.3/installing/install_config/installing-restricted-networks-preparations.html#installation-about-mirror-registry_installing-restricted-networks-preparations) 
- [About building the local catalog, mirroring images, and setting up the content source policy insid ethe cluster](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.3/operators/olm-restricted-networks.html#olm-understanding-operator-catalog-images_olm-restricted-networks)
- [More information about OpenShift 4.3 image registry repository mirroring](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.3/openshift_images/image-configuration.html#images-configuration-registry-mirror_image-configuration) 

### Specifics of this procedure

- This can be applied on **any OpenShift 4.3 cluster having at least 2 master nodes** (=> **not** CRC),
even if the cluster is not really disconnected
- The main goal is to check that, finally, all the CHE-relate docker images are **pulled from the mirror docker registry** instead of the initial external registry (quay.io, docker.io, ...)
- To make installation easier, the mirror docker registry is **deployed inside the cluster and made available through a route**. This allows the mirror docker registry being reachable even from a cluster that cannot reach any local machine.
This differs from the official documentation which requires installing the mirror docker registry on a bastion host that is both connected to the internet and reachable by the cluster. However this difference doesn't impact the tests we're doing here.
- Another difference is that the mirror docker registry deployed here **doesn't have any authentication** to make pulls from the cluster easy, without having to add credentials in the cluster. In real-life scenarios it would have some authentication. However this also doesn't impact the meaningfullness of these tests.

### Steps to apply


#### Prepare the package with digests and relatedImages

- Download the last 4.3.1 oc command line tool from https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/clients/ocp/latest-4.3/

- Optionally change/modify the content of the example OLM package + CSV available in [`eclipse-che-preview-openshift/deploy/olm-catalog/eclipse-che-preview-openshift` folder](./eclipse-che-preview-openshift/deploy/olm-catalog/eclipse-che-preview-openshift) of this GitHub repository.

  **NOTE:** The Upstream Che devfile and plugin registries seem to be currently incompatible with restricted environment, since they finally reference several images with the same name and distinct tags. That's **not** the case of the CRW registries, so the docker images of registries in this Upstream Che OLM package were replaced with the `2.1` CRW registries rebuilt with options similar to the following build arguments:

    - for the devfile registry:
    
    ```
    --use-digests --offline
    ```

    - for the plugin registry:
    
    ```
    --use-digests --offline --latest-only
    ```


- Replace tags with digests in the CSV, and add the `replaceImages` field by using the following script:

  ```bash
  ./addDigests.sh
  ```

  This will create an updated CSV into the following folder:

  ```
  generated/eclipse-che-preview-openshift/7.9.0/
  ```

#### Push the generated OLM package to a Quay.io application

- Setup your `AUTH_TOKEN` to Connect to Quay (after providing your `quay.io` user name and password as environment variables).

  ```bash
  AUTH_TOKEN=$(curl -sH "Content-Type: application/json" -XPOST https://quay.io/cnr/api/v1/users/login -d '                                     
  {                  
      "user": {
          "username": "'"${QUAY_USERNAME}"'",
          "password": "'"${QUAY_PASSWORD}"'"
      }
  }' | jq -r '.token')
  ```

- Define your Quay organization you want to push the OLM package to as a Quay application (change `dfestal-tests` to the chosen organization):

  ```bash
  export MY_QUAY_ORG=dfestal-tests
  ```

- Push the catalog to your Quay application:

  ```bash
  operator-courier push generated/eclipse-che-preview-openshift ${MY_QUAY_ORG} eclipse-che-preview-openshift 9.9.$(date +%s) "$AUTH_TOKEN"
  ```

#### Start a cluster and deploy the mirror docker registry on the cluster (option 1)

**NOTE:** The steps in this section are not required if you already installed a disconnected cluster as well as a mirror registry

- Start a cluster on cluster bot for example, download the provided kubeconfig as the `.kubeconfig` file

  ```bash
  export KUBECONFIG=.kubeconfig
  ```

- Log to the Openshift cluster as `kubeadmin`

  ```bash
  oc login
  ```

- Deploy the docker v2 mirror registry to the new cluster. It will create the registry in the fixed `mirror-docker-registry` namespace

  ```bash
  ./deploy-registry.sh
  export REGISTRY_HOST="route-mirror-docker-registry.$(oc get ingresses.config.openshift.io cluster -o=jsonpath='{ .spec.domain }')"
  ```

- Add the certificates of the mirror docker registry to the trusted certificates of the local machine (warning: instructions for RHEL / Centos here)
 
  ```bash
  sudo cp mirror-docker-registry-ca.crt /etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors
  sudo update-ca-trust
  ```

- Restart the docker deamon and test the login to the new mirror registry (any user / password is OK, since the registry has not authentication)

  ```bash
  sudo systemctl restart docker.service
  docker login $REGISTRY_HOST 
  ```

#### Connect to an existing disconnected cluster and associated mirror docker registry (option 2)

**NOTE:** The steps in this alternate section are only required if you already installed a disconnected cluster as well as a mirror registry

- Retrieve the cluster kubeconfig, and save it as the `.kubeconfig` file. Then create the following environemnt variable:

  ```bash
  export KUBECONFIG=.kubeconfig
  ```

  **NOTE:** If you created the disconnected environment from a Flex Jenkins Job, the kubeconfig should be available in the build artifacts, at the following related path:
  ```
  workdir/install-dir/auth/kubeconfig
  ```

- Log to the Openshift cluster as `kubeadmin`

  ```bash
  oc login
  ```

  The `kubeadmin` password is provided in a file at the same place.

- Set the following variable to be the `<host>:<port>` of your docker mirror on your bastion host

  ```bash
  export REGISTRY_HOST="<host>:<port>"
  ```

  **NOTE:** If you created the disconnected environment from a Flex Jenkins Job, the registry host is provided by the `INT_SVC_INSTANCE_PUBLIC_IP` field of the build artifact at the following related path:
  ```
  workdir/install-dir/src_cluster_info.json
  ```
  And the registry port is `5000`

- Add the certificates of the mirror docker registry to the trusted certificates of the local machine (warning: instructions for RHEL / Centos here)
 
  ```bash
  sudo cp <docker registry public certificate authority file> /etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors
  sudo update-ca-trust
  ```

  **NOTE:** If you created the disconnected environment from a Flex Jenkins Job, the certificate should be
  available by decoding the `base64` value found in the
  `additional_ca` field of the chosen Jenkins Job template.

- Restart your docker deamon and test the login to the new mirror registry (any user / password is OK, since the registry has not authentication)

  ```bash
  sudo systemctl restart docker.service
  docker login $REGISTRY_HOST 
  ```

#### Mirror the OLM package Quay.io application to the cluster

- Build the local catalog from your Quay.io application and push it to the mirror docker registry:

  ```bash
  oc adm catalog build --appregistry-endpoint https://quay.io/cnr --appregistry-org ${MY_QUAY_ORG} --to=${REGISTRY_HOST}/catalog/eclipse-che-preview-openshift:v1
  ```

- Mirror the docker images referenced by your local catalog to your mirror docker registry.

  ```bash
  oc adm catalog mirror --manifests-only=true ${REGISTRY_HOST}/catalog/eclipse-che-preview-openshift:v1 ${REGISTRY_HOST}
  oc image mirror --max-per-registry=1 --filename=eclipse-che-preview-openshift-manifests/mapping.txt
  ```

- Apply the `ImageContentSourcePolicy` generated in the `eclipse-che-preview-openshift-manifests` folder by the previous step:

  ```bash
  oc apply -f ./eclipse-che-preview-openshift-manifests/
  ```

- Wait for the end of the configuration update and restart of all cluster nodes, until all 2 `MachineConfigPool`s (master and workers) are fully updated.

#### Install the local catalog source, subscribe and  test

- Get the OpenShift console URL by running:

  ```bash
  echo "https://$(oc get routes console -n openshift-console --output=jsonpath={.spec.host})"
  ```

- Disable the default OperatorSources in the Cluster. Nothing should appear in the OperatorHub catalog anymore:

  ```bash
  oc patch OperatorHub cluster --type json -p '[{"op": "add", "path": "/spec/disableAllDefaultSources", "value": true}]'
  ```

- Deploy the local catalog matadata and operator group to prepare operator installation. This will create a fixed `test-restricted-che-install` namespace and propose the operator inside it
 
  ```bash
  ./deploy-catalog.sh
  ```

- In the Openshift console, go into the `test-restricted-che-install` namespace

- In the OperatorHub, you shoud now see the Eclipse Che operator available for installation 

- Install it as usual.

- While it is installing, In the logs of the `mirror-docker-registry` POD (in the `mirror-docker-registry` namespace) you should already see that the Che operator image is automatically pulled from the internal registry.

- Add at least a real user besides `kubeadmin` (via adding a `htpasswd` identity provider and logging at least once as a regular user)

- Create `CheCluster` custom resource to start the installation

- In the logs of the `mirror-docker-registry` POD (in the `mirror-docker-registry` namespace), look how, during the installation, the Che images are automatically pulled from the internal registry.
